## Testing

### Test Script

Use the provided test script to verify quote reel generation:

```bash
./test_reel_quote.sh
```

### Manual Testing

1. Start the server:
```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run --allow-ffi --allow-sys --allow-env src/server.ts
```

2. Generate a quote reel:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/generate-reel \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @example_reel_input.json \
  --output test_reel.mp4
```

3. Verify the output:
```bash
file test_reel.mp4
ffprobe test_reel.mp4
```

## Technical Details

### Image Generation Process

1. Parse quote text and extract highlighted phrases
2. Create 1080x1920 canvas with background image
3. Calculate text layout with automatic wrapping
4. Draw highlight backgrounds for marked phrases
5. Render quote text and author attribution
6. Export as JPEG (95% quality)

### Video Generation Process

1. Generate quote image (if quote provided)
2. Use FFmpeg to convert image to video:
   - Loop the image for specified duration
   - Scale to 1080x1920 (force aspect ratio)
   - Encode with H.264 codec
   - 30fps frame rate
   - Add audio track if provided
3. Clean up temporary image file
4. Return MP4 video

### Temporary Files

The generator creates a temporary file `quote_image_temp.jpg` during processing. This file is automatically cleaned up after the video is generated.

## Backward Compatibility

The reel generator still supports the original image-based input:

```json
{
  "imagePath": "assets/images/custom_image.jpg",
  "duration": 5
}
```

Either `quote` or `imagePath` must be provided, but not both.

## Troubleshooting

### Quote text is cut off

- Reduce the amount of text in the quote
- The generator automatically wraps text, but very long quotes may not fit
- Consider breaking a long quote into multiple reels

### Text not highlighted

- All quote text should have yellow highlight backgrounds automatically
- Verify the background image exists at `assets/images/background.jpeg`
- Check that fonts are properly loaded from `assets/fonts/`

### Font rendering issues

- Verify Merriweather font files are in `assets/fonts/`
- Check file permissions on font files

### Video generation fails

- Ensure FFmpeg is installed: `ffmpeg -version`
- Check that background image exists: `assets/images/background.jpeg`
- Verify server has `--allow-ffi` permission for canvas rendering

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it Short**: Quotes under 200 characters work best
2. **Strategic Highlights**: Highlight 2-3 key phrases maximum
3. **Clear Attribution**: Always include the author name
4. **Line Breaks**: Use `\n` to control paragraph breaks
5. **Preview First**: Generate and review the reel before posting
6. **Background Music**: Choose music that matches the quote's mood
7. **Duration**: 5-8 seconds works well for quote reels

## Integration Examples

### n8n Workflow

```javascript
// n8n Function Node
const quote = $json.quote;
const author = $json.author;

return {
  json: {
    quote: quote,
    author: author,
    duration: 6
  }
};
```

### Make.com Scenario

Use HTTP Request module with:
- URL: `https://your-server.com/generate-reel`
- Method: POST
- Body: JSON with quote and author fields
- Response parsing: Binary (save as file)
