  "You mentally tally favors and present the receipt when it's convenient.",
  "You count who texts first, who pays, who apologizes—relationships feel like a ledger.",
  "You bring up past favors in fights to score points.",
  "You feel quiet resentment when people don’t 'repay' your kindness.",
  "You withhold help or affection until the balance tips in your favor.",
  "You make decisions to even the score instead of because they’re right or kind.",
  "You weaponize the tally—guilt, silent treatment, or reminders become bargaining chips."
