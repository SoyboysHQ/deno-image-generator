  "Loss aversion — losing feels worse than gaining feels good, so avoiding loss often drives choices more than chasing wins.",
  "Social proof — we take popularity as a shortcut to truth; seeing others choose reduces our friction to follow.",
  "Scarcity — limited supply or time inflates value and forces faster commitments.",
  "Reciprocity — a small favor creates an obligation; generosity reliably earns future yeses.",
  "Authority — perceived expertise or endorsement shortcuts doubt and bends decisions.",
